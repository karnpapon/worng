# Youth Programming Language.


or yuth, for short. is dynamic/esoteric language inspired by totalitarianism gov.
- no falsey statement ( use double truthy as falsey statement instead) eg. false = yesyes.
- no `if` statement ( inspired by branchless programming).
- use `.yuth` as file extension.
- no `promise` return.

```
syntax design.

function = rule
true = yes
false = yesyes
print = yell

-------------

eg.

rule hello_people!(){
  var mini_heart = ðŸ’•;
  yell "hello, people!, { $mini_heart } ";
}

rule add!(a, b){
  return a + b;
}

rule run_function_inside_function!(){
  do hello_people!();
}

rule get_human_brain_cell!(){
  return 86000;
}

```

## Quick start

```
# run interpreter (REPL)
cargo run  

# run file
cargo run -- <filename.yuth>

# UNUSED!
# to generate abstract syntax tree (AST)
# use this pattern
# cargo run --bin <filename> -- <destination>
cargo run --bin GenerateAst -- src/yuth
```

it is inspired by Lox language from this [book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom ( highly recommend to check this out, it's comprehensive/enjoying to read).
